# Smart_Hand_Washing_Timer_System_Development
This project focuses on creating a smart system that encourages proper hand-washing practices by integrating a proximity sensor, a timer, and a display unit. The system detects when a user places their hands under the sensor and starts a 30-second countdown, the recommended duration for effective hand washing.
