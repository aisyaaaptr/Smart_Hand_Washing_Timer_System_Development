# Smart Hand Washing Timer System Development
This project focuses on creating a smart system that encourages proper hand-washing practices by integrating a proximity sensor, a timer, and a display unit. The system detects when a user places their hands under the sensor and starts a 30-second countdown, the recommended duration for effective hand washing. 

## Tools
- Poximity Sensor
- Arduino Nano
- Buzzer
- Jumper 
- LCD Oled
- Arduino IDE

## Goals 
As an IoT intern at PT Kalbe Morinaga Indonesia, my goal is to create an easy-to-use and efficient tool to promote proper hand washing habits. This project aims to improve hygiene practices by providing a smart system that ultimately contributes to improved employee health.

## Step 1:  Requirement Analysis
- Identify the system's functional and non-functional requirements, such as sensor specifications, timer duration, and display type.
- Research recommended practices for proper hand washing to ensure the system adheres to health guidelines.
  
## Step 2:  Component Selection
- Select a suitable proximity sensor to detect hands under the device.
- Choose a microcontroller to integrate and control all system components.
- Decide on the type of display unit for showing the countdown.

## Step 3: System Design
- Create a schematic diagram of the system, illustrating the connections between the sensor, timer, display, and power supply.
- Design the physical casing to ensure the device is compact, durable, and resistant to environmental factors like water and dust.

## Step 4: Prototyping
- Assemble the selected components based on the schematic design.
- Write and upload the code to the microcontroller for handling sensor input, initiating the timer, and controlling the display output.
- Test the prototype on a small scale to validate the basic functionality.
